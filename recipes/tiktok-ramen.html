        <h3>What is Tiktok ramen?</h3>
        <p>Tiktok ramen is where you use instant ramen noodles, ditch the seasoning packet, and make your own sauce. Unlike soup-y ramen, Tiktok ramen is a soup-less ramen, kind of like mazemen or sesame noodles. Ramen noodles are tossed in a garlic butter soy brown sugar sauce, cooked with an egg and finished with a sprinkle of everything bagel seasoning.</p>

            <li>- PREP TIME: 15 mins</li>
            <li>- SERVINGS: 1 serving</li>          
        </ul>
        

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>butter - just bit of butter is melted down to cook up some garlic.</li>
            <li>garlic - you need about 1 teaspoon of chopped or minced garlic. Or, if you’re a garlic lover, use as many cloves as you can handle.</li>
            <li>brown sugar - the brown sugar adds a bit of caramel sweetness and color. If you don’t have brown sugar, you can use regular sugar or even honey.</li>
            <li>soy sauce - use your favorite soy sauce - we like Yamasa or Kikkoman.</li>
            <li>crushed red pepper flakes - you can add as many chili flakes as you like or leave them out all together, depending on your spice tolerance.</li>
            <li>egg - throw an egg on it because ramen without an egg isn’t even ramen.</li>
            <li>everything bagel spice - make it rain everything bagel spice!</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Cook your instant ramen</li>
                <p>Don’t overcook it – mushy noodles are a travesty. Instant ramen should have an al dente bite. Pop the noodles into boiling water, set a timer, use a pair of chopsticks to loose the them up, and when the time is up, instantly drain them and set them aside. Pro tip: if you’re a true noodle lover, cook the noodles slightly less than the suggested cooking time, they will cook up a bit more while you’re tossing them in the sauce. This way you’ll have perfectly al dente noodles.</p>
            <li style="font-weight:bold;">Make the sauce</li>
                <p>In a pan, heat up the butter over low heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft. Stir in the crushed red pepper, then the brown sugar and soy sauce.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Toss</li>
                <p>Add the drained noodles to the pan, turn up the heat, and toss to coat.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Cook the egg</li>
                <p>Push the noodles to one side and add an egg to the pan and scramble until just set.</p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">Serve</li>
                <p>Place the noodles in a bowl and finish with sliced scallions and everything bagel spice. Enjoy hot!</p>
